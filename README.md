# snowflake-RLS-ColumnMasking

This repository has setup scripts for demonstration of Row Level Security and Column Masking features in Snowflake.
This is synonymous to Oracle's VPD and Column Redaction features.

## Scripts

seeding.sql -> 
1. Creates a database and schema
2. Creates emp and dept tables and seeds sample data into those tables.
###### Note: Those familiar with Oracle's emp and dept tables, they will recognize these scripts and data.
